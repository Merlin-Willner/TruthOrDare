First of all a huge thanks to everyone from the CS50 stuff, who made all of this even possible.
Without you I may not have have started this whole Journey.
You literlly changed my life...

But now lets go on with the reason why I chose to make this Truth or Dare App as my Final Project:
Basically I had a tradition with some of my friends, that everytime we met, we played some kind of game like 'Mäxxle', 'Never have I ever' and obviosly:

Truth or Dare

There is more than just that but that is also described inside the app on the 'About' Page.

The Idea was to make the best Party-Game-App available on the market with multiple games, a messanger and different Events.
But as discribed on the official Final Project Page:
"In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope."
Furthermore this question occurred:
What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

The best outcome would have been to make the best app available out there.
But let's be realistically: 
That probably is not the case when you are limited to only 2 Month, don't know the language, the framework, git & github and the ide.

So I think the outcome that I have right now is somewhere on the better end of good.
At least considering where I started.


-What I have now is a Truth or Dare App that has a Loginpage with Google Signin and a Guest Signin.

-A Topics Page, where you can choose between a 'civilized mode' and a 'Party mode'

-An About Page, where I kind of describe my motivation and how this journey went.
   In addition there are two links: 
     one to Harvards CS50 Page and 
     one to my Instagram account.

-A Profile Page, with a signout button and another link to my instagram for some user feedback


Lastly lets quickly go over each file and what they do:
